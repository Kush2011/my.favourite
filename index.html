            <p>I love reading books since my age of four now I am in fourth class and my age is eight My favourite books are about Geronimo Stilton, I can answer any question about it. Reading is a good habit and especialy now because of the covid pandemics.Read books, borrow books and so much more ways to read books so keep reading. Remember knowledge is more important then imagination and books are the best ways to increase imagination so keep reading till you stop.</p>
